# 📡 Data Exfiltration Techniques

Educational scripts demonstrating data exfiltration methods for security research and defensive analysis.

## Purpose
This section contains examples of various data exfiltration techniques to help security professionals:
- Understand how data can be exfiltrated
- Build better detection mechanisms
- Test DLP (Data Loss Prevention) solutions
- Improve network security monitoring

## Planned Scripts
- `dns_exfil.py` - DNS-based data exfiltration demonstrations
- `http_exfil.py` - HTTP/HTTPS exfiltration techniques
- `icmp_exfil.py` - ICMP tunnel demonstrations
- `webhook_exfil.py` - Webhook-based exfiltration

## Requirements
See `Python/requirements.txt` for dependencies.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
These scripts are for educational and authorized security testing only. Use only in controlled lab environments or with explicit authorization.

## Educational Value
Understanding exfiltration techniques helps in:
- Building better detection rules
- Configuring firewalls and IDS/IPS
- Testing security controls
- Incident response preparation

## Contributing
Contributions welcome! Focus on educational value and defensive applications. Include detection methods alongside each exfiltration technique.

## Detection
For each technique, we aim to provide:
- How to detect the activity
- Network signatures
- Log analysis methods
- Mitigation strategies
